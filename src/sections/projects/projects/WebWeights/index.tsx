      <p className="content">For the last few years I have used time outside of work to pursue a passion in web development, this started with a small project to collect gym data and grew to a project to test my latest ideas and try new technologies in anger. Over the years it has progressed from an EC2 instance hosted website using HTML/CSS/PHP to a Vue.JS application hosted on an S3 bucket to its current form which is a React app hosted using server less AWS services. This project has helped me rapidly learn new skills and try ideas which I would be unable to try in the workplace. Through this development I have found a great interest in moving this over to an iOS based application, this has come from my understanding of TypeScript and its similarities to swift.</p>
