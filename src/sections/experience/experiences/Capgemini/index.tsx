      <p className="content">Working at Capgemini I have been developing the React frontend. Connecting graphQL queries and the user. Whilst also having input in the design and usability of the website, which I am in the process of completing the Google Professional UX Course. Missguided have given me a great opportunity to work in e-commerce with the quick turn around of new features and fixes to the live system. Working in this environment has allowed me to pick up new techniques when considering web design and development as I have worked with colleagues from different parts of the UK and overseas.</p>
